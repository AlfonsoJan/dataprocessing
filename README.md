# Differentialy Expressed Genes (DEGs)


## Abstract
This study is about the development of T-cells if critically dependent on successful rearrangement of antigen-receptors. Only cells that successfully pass the bèta-selection checkpoint continue in development with functional rearrangement. However, it is not clear what the fate of non-selected T-cell is. In this study, CD27 down-regulation is identified at the DN3 stage to be a marker for cells that have failed rearrangement of the bèta-chain and will therefore undergo apoptosis. Gene expression analysis revealed high expression of the transcription factor Duxbl within this population. The results of this study are, that CD27 down-regulation is associated with an unsuccessful bèta-chain rearrangement and/or pre-TCR formation. On the other hand, high CD27 expression is associated with pre-TCR signaling and successful passage through the bèta-selection checkpoint.

## Desired Result

I want to replicate part of the study. I want to recreate and compare 6 specific figures.

- A heat map displaying the euclidean distances between all the samples.
- A volcano plot of differentially expressed genes between DN3a CD27low and DN3a CD27high.
- A MDS plot that displays similarity calculated distances in a 2D-plot.
